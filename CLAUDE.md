# PureFFT.jl — agent guidelines

These are project-specific REQUIREMENTS for anyone (human or agent) working on PureFFT. They are
hard-won — violating them has caused 100×+ regressions and multi-session dead ends. Full detail and
measurements are in `docs/src/performance.md`; this file is the must-follow summary.

## Performance requirements (MUST follow)

1. **Unroll fixed-count loops with `@generated`. NEVER index a tuple with a runtime variable.**
   `t[r]` / `t[2r+1]` where `r` is a loop variable is type-unstable and **boxes/allocates**
   (measured **135× slowdown**: a size-36 kernel went 2293ns → 18ns just from removing it). Emit
   straight-line code from a `@generated` function (the count comes from a type parameter), or unroll
   with **literal** indices. PureFFT already does this in `src/codelets.jl` (8 `@generated` codelets).
   - `@generated` is preferred over macro-based unrollers (e.g. Unroll.jl's `@unroll`) because our
     counts are *type parameters*, not macro-time literals. **Do not add Unroll.jl as a dependency**
     (it's inactive) — borrow the idea (emit straight-line code, unroll counter-dependent branches)
     via `@generated`.

2. **`@simd ivdep` + `@inbounds`** on dependency-free, contiguous numeric loops (twiddle multiplies,
   AoS↔SoA split/merge, copies). NOT on strided/scatter loops or loops with real cross-iteration deps.

3. **x86 SIMD intrinsics with no SIMD.jl wrapper → `Base.llvmcall`** to the exact LLVM intrinsic,
   module+entry form, converting `Vec ↔ v.data::NTuple{N,VecElement{T}}`. Example (verified bit-exact):
   `fmaddsub`/`fmsubadd` via `@llvm.x86.fma.vf{madd,msub}sub.pd.256`. See `port/avxport.jl`.

4. **SIMD via SIMD.jl**: `Vec`, `shufflevector` (lane permutes — match the intrinsic's exact lane
   pattern when porting), `reinterpret` (bitwise ops like xor on floats), `muladd` (FMA). `vload`/
   `vstore` over `reinterpret(Ptr{T}, pointer(x))` for complex buffers.

5. **Keep the hot path dispatch-free**: concrete types, transform size / factors as *type parameters*
   so `@generated` specializes. Verify with JET `@test_opt`. Keep trim-safe (`Vector{Any}` only in
   `@generated` generators, never at runtime — verify with TrimCheck `@validate`).

## Faithful-port methodology (for the non-pow2 / RustFFT parity work)

- **Duplicate RustFFT's algorithm EXACTLY** (op-for-op, same SIMD), do NOT reinterpret. Reinterpreting
  in our own style repeatedly plateaued at local maxima (~0.5–0.85× FFTW across many attempts — see
  `docs/src/performance.md` and the memory notes). A faithful mechanical port reaches parity
  (Butterfly36 = 0.92× rust). Source of truth: rustfft 6.4.1 (`/tmp/RustFFT`, = the crate).
- **Verify each layer BIT-EXACT against Rust golden values** (the harness in
  `bench/rustfft_compare/`, `cargo run --bin verify` → `golden.txt`; Julia diff in `port/`) before
  building the next layer up. Numerically expect ≤1e-15 rel-error (twiddle cos/sin may differ 1 ULP).

## Standing rules

- `isnothing(x)` / `!isnothing(x)` — never `=== nothing` / `!== nothing`.
- **Regenerate `bench/plot_compare.jl` plots before every push** (catches regressions; benches need
  the CPU `performance` governor for stable numbers).
- Commit author email: `15278831+el-oso@users.noreply.github.com` (never a real address).
- End commit messages with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- No Python anywhere (per the global rule).
